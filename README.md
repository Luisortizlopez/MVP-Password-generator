 Password-generator App

## Sub-Heading ##
 This app can have a wide range of audience from teenagers using multiple Social Networks accounts to people who just may not be creative in coming up with a password 

## Summary ##
 The Password-generator app will help you improve Password security level, by generating a random password made up of letters and numbers.
 while this is still in development proccess the goal is to add an aditional feature to store all used password in a secure vault
 Try it out! Generate new Passwords (which no one could ever guess) for your future online accounts.

## Problem ##
Some times it's hard to come up with a pasword when signing up for an online account and you defenetly don't want to use
"123, birthdate, name or password" as your password, this could mean almost any one could guess your password(most likely people close to you).
That is something we want to avoid, just imagine someone guessing your facebook password(ahhhhhh! that's a headache for sure).

## Solution ##
So how do we solve this problem? 
Tha answer is, creating an app that will generate a list of random passwords(cositant of random letters and nums).
Making it imposible to guess the combination of letters and nums.
